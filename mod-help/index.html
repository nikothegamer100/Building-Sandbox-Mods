          <b><h1>Introduction</h1></b>
          <p>While building sandbox may feel like a regular building game on roblox, you can create mods. Keep in mind, mods goes through verification process before actually getting into game. This is so people wont create malicious mods.</p>
          <b><h1>How to test the mods?</h1></b>
          <p>There is actually a game for mod testing. <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/11346814872/Mod-Testing-Place">Mod testing place.</a></p>
          <b><h1>Getting started | Getting the model</h1></b>
          <p>You should locate 'example_mod_0.3.rbxm in #mod-instructions channel in <a href="https://discord.gg/fuj3XvRjwX"> Building Sandbox server</a>.</p>
          <b><h1>Getting started | Code</h1></b>
          <p>You should have small knowledge on lua atleast before starting to code a mod for this game. You should locate ModuleScript 'events' inside the example mod, this is the script where the main code mostly should be in.</p>
          <b><h1>Sandbox functions and what they do</h1></b>
          <p><b>Sandbox.on </b> </br> This function is quite useful, as you can detect when block is placed or removed, when player chats, etc. </br> Example: </br> Sandbox.on("place", function(info) print(info.player.Name) end)</p>
